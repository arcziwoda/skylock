## Migration from GitLab

This project was originally hosted on a private GitLab server at my university and has now been migrated to GitHub as part of my portfolio. During the migration, all Git history, branches, and commits were preserved.

The repository previously included GitLab CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment. Since GitHub Actions can serve a similar purpose, future updates may include a migration of these pipelines to GitHub Actions.
